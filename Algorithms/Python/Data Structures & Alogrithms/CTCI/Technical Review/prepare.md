## Important Reminders when practicing problem solving:
1. Take as long as you need to solve a problem. Each problem is meant to be difficult. Reading a solution and not excercising problem solving isn't helpful.
2. Write your problems in a piece of paper / use a white board to excercise the actual problem. IDES / text editors aid with syntax highlighting and more.
3. Always remember to test your code and make your own test cases.
    - general test cases
    - base cases 
    - error cases 
4. Transfer your paper code as is into your text editor / IDE. It will help you realize your mistakes. 

## Before anything, make sure you're comfortable with the following Data Structures:
+ [ ] Data Structures 
  + [ ] Linked Lists
  + [ ] Trees, Tries, and Graphs
  + [ ] Stacks & Queues 
  + [ ] Heaps
  + [ ] Vectors / ArrayLists
  + [ ] Hash Tables
+ [ ] Algorithms
  + [ ] Breathe-First Search
  + [ ] Depth-First Search
  + [ ] Binary Search
  + [ ] Merge Sort
  + [ ] Quick Sort
+ [ ] Concepts  
  + [ ] Bit Manipulation
  + [ ] Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
  + [ ] Recursion
  + [ ] Dynamic Programming
  + [ ] Big-O Time and Space

## Good Code is . . .
+ Modularized
+ Error Checks
+ Use other classes / structures when appropriate
+ Good Variable Names
Everyone has their own style / definition of good code. Redefine your *own* definition later on.
