## What is sorting?
> Sorting - Arrange systemematically in groups; seperate according to type, class, etc.

Okay but why? When learning data structures we want to be able to manipulate **data** as efficient as possible. 

#### Example 1. 
If I want to arrange a set of toys by color I would visually:
1. First look if they're sorted the way I want them to, if they are then we're done
2. If they are not I would go through each toy one by one and check if the toys match the sequence I want them to be sorted in.

The second step is what sorting is. We have a set of *objects* and we want to find a way to organize them a way we want. 

#### Imagine this ...
Let's say you've graduated and you're a SWE. You have the task of sorting a client's data (it could be their expenses, payments, etc) and you want to accomplish that task as fast as possible.
 
This is where sorting algorithms come into play. There is **not** a one way to sort a set of objects; there are plenty of ways to accomplish this task. However, there are algorithms that complete this task better than others.
